[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:09,573
Okay, so we left

3
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:16,080
off with action potential.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,340
So we've got a message going from one end
of a cell to another end of a

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,190
cell, and now we're going to get that
message

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,910
across to another cell through something
called a synapse.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,260
But the this like, so, so getting the
action potential is like

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,280
I have breathed out all this air, and now
I just have to form

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,040
my lips to, to make sound, but in the case
of the neuron.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,420
This neuron is obviously not talking in
sound.

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,720
It's talking in chemistry.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,970
It's talking in things like
neurotransmitters.

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:01,080
And neurotransmitters, are a list of, or a
number of molecules.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,110
They serve other functions in the body,
but

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,680
they also serve very critical functions
for the

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,290
nervous system as neurotransmitters, as
the things that

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,600
that communicate from one neuron to
another neuron.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,620
And what we're going to look at right now,

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,610
is how neurotransmitters are made and how
they're packaged.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,020
So this is a drawing of a cell, here's the
cell body, the nucleus

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,190
with the DNA, here are some mitochondria,
this is the powerhouse of the cell.

22
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,860
The endoplasmic reticulum, which is
essentially the

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,320
manufacturing centre of the cell where
proteins

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,270
are made, and then we have an axon which
leads down to a synaptic terminal.

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,640
And this synaptic terminal has these
entities

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,800
here, which are called synaptic vesicles

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,750
and they're small little, organelles.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,230
They're little vesicles, they, they're
made of a

29
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,140
membrane, just like the, the cell is, has
a,

30
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,240
has a cell membrane, these vesicles have a
vesicular

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,760
membrane, and if we look at one of these.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,430
So it has a membrane, remember that the
membrane looks

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,900
something like this but we're not going to
draw that all.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,439
So here's the membrane, and inside here is
neurotransmitter.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,220
Is a, is a neurotransmitter.

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,160
And, the neurotransmitter can be any
number

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,530
of of a number of different molecules.

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,660
Here are just a few of them Glutamate,
GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine, Acetylcholine.

39
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,740
There's a more complete list that you can
see and the

40
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,410
only other thing I want to add is, why is
this important?

41
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,940
Why is it important?

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,540
Well, first of all, it's important that
the neurotransmitters are packaged

43
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,490
in, is vesicles and that'll be important
in, in a moment.

44
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,080
The second thing that's important about
this is that we can use this.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,830
We can use the synthesis of a
neurotransmitter

46
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,250
as a, as a, as a therapeutic tool.

47
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,670
So, for instance Dopamine is missing in
Parkinsons disease.

48
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,330
It's not that dopamine isn't made per say,
that's there's a problem with making it.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,530
It's that the cells that make it die.

50
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,500
So, or, or a group of the cells that do

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,100
make Dopamine die, and so what do you do
about that?

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,150
Well it turns out that there's something
called Mass

53
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,370
Effect which means, that you take the
starting chemical.

54
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,710
The, the, the substrate.

55
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,640
What we call the substrate and then
through a series of enzymatic

56
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,820
Processes reaction through a series of
enzymatic reactions, we end up with a

57
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,850
neurotransmitter and in the case of
Dopamine,

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,410
in Parkinson's there is lack of Dopamine
and what happ,

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,000
what do we do to treat in most people
Parkinson's.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,190
We give them the substrate, and so that is
what Sinemet

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,996
which is also in, in other countries
called Parcopa.

62
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:33,720
so, th-, these are drugs that provide a
lot

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,540
of this, and even if only a little bit of
this gets made, much less

64
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,290
than what you start with, it's more than
what the, the person

65
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,440
has, and it enables them, it, it
alleviates their symptoms of Parkinson's.

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,900
So you flood the system with substrate,
and the goal is

67
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,780
to get a little bit of that
neurotransmitter out of the system.

68
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,460
Okay.

69
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,990
So that's how we're going to speak what's
coming

70
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,980
out of the neurons mouth, so to speak.

71
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,180
Is not sound, but neurotransmitter.

72
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,130
Neurotransmitter that is packaged in
vesicles, and in

73
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,380
the next segment we are going too see how.

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,410
How it actually gets out of the mouth.

75
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,370
