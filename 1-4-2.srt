2
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:15,160
So, the difference between the peripheral

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,910
and the central nervous system, is
important.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,440
It's incredibly important because the
diseases.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,990
That affect the nervous system, affect

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,630
either peripheral or central nervous
system.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,180
They don't tend to affect both.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,910
They're very few.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,830
And the meninges form a very effective
barrier against.

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,260
Toxins, against viruses, against all sorts
of damage, so that the peripheral nervous

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,580
system tends to be far more vulnerable,
than is the central nervous system.

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:01,790
In addition, the two regions have very
different capacities for repair.

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:09,430
If you cut a, an axon in the peripheral
nervous system, it can repair itself.

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,840
It will reconnect.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,370
If there's a traumatic injury to the

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,710
central nervous system that does not
happen.

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,557
So, the ability to repair is far, far
greater

18
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:24,750
in the periphery than in, in the central
nervous system.

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,930
And ever since I was a graduate student in
the early 80s,

20
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,670
this has been a topic that people have
been very interested in.

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,590
They've been trying to make the central
environment

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,790
more hospitable to repair, more like the
peripheral environment.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,410
This is something that, this is a, a, a
research

24
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,700
area that's had some successes but is,
presents an ongoing challenge.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,200
And the truth is that today we still have
not achieved

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,870
the ability to regenerate or repair within
the central nervous system.

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,310
So let's, let's look at some of the

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,650
Ways in which the peripheral nervous
system is vulnerable.

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:21,060
So, it's vulnerable to say a, large
molecules such as botulinum toxin.

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,132
So, botulinum toxin which comes from
spoiled food can get in and it

31
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:36,050
primarily will effect these peripheral, it
will only effect these peripheral neurons.

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,660
It will not get past the meninges.

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,300
Let's take another example which is
viruses and so.

34
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,810
When there is a, one of the viruses is
polio.

35
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,830
And polio virus, actually gets in right
here at this

36
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,880
synapse between the motor neuron and the
voluntary muscle, and it goes back.

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,130
It travels back and see, it did a clever
thing.

38
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,500
It got through the meninges.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,410
But it got through the meninges by getting

40
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,000
in through this the axon of this motor
neuron.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,180
And what does it do in return?

42
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,240
For thanks, it actually kills this motor
neuron.

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,499
So now, this motor neuron is going to die.

44
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:29,220
And there, therefore, there is going to be
weakness or an inability

45
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,900
to move that muscle that was infected with
the polio virus.

46
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,270
Let's look at another virus herpes zoster,
and herpes

47
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,810
zoster is a virus that, that produces
what's commonly called as shingles.

48
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,950
And in herpes zoster, the, the virus gets

49
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,870
in here, it gets transported back inside
the

50
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,430
cell, inside the axon in these sensory
neurons,

51
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,380
and then it goes and lives in here.

52
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,790
And if all is great, all is well.

53
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,700
It lives in there and then it never talks
again.

54
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,310
But, under some circumstances, the virus
can decide to

55
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,900
reproduce and blossom, and it will make so
many copies of

56
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,025
itself that it actually sends it back out
that way, and what you get is.

57
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:30,150
A virus all throughout the sensory
territory, and what you get is a rash.

58
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,880
So this is the skin, the sensory neuron
has a process

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,870
that ends in the skin, it takes up this
herpes zoster.

60
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,690
This zoster lives in the cell body, but if
there's an outbreak, it will send

61
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,090
all these virus particles back out to the
skin and you'll get a rash.

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,360
And here is an example of somebody who has
a rash.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,180
Now, let's notice a couple things about
it.

64
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,990
First of all, it's only on one side.

65
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,800
Because the infection is only on one

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,490
side and,and these sensory neurons, are,
are going to

67
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,190
obey the midline perfectly, so it, the

68
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,740
other half of the face is completely
unaffected.

69
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,960
The other thing that you notice, is that
it's, it's in this distribution, and

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,580
this distribution is one of the most
common places to have shingles.

71
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,550
The common place is in the thoracic region
right about here.

72
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,050
So and this is a distribution

73
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,430
that has an anatomical basis.

74
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,800
This is the ophthalmic division of the
trigeminal nerve.

75
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,710
Luckily, this does go away.

76
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,020
And, it did go away for this individual.

77
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,020
So, another, another example that's more
like botulinum toxin is sarin.

78
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,480
Sarin is a big molecule.

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,200
And it's only going to affect the
periphery.

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,110
It's not going to affect the central
nervous system.

81
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:08,820
In the next segment, we're going to talk
about brain tumors.

82
