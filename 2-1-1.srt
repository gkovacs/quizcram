00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:13,399
Okay.

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:19,590
So in this unit, we're going to talk about
how neurons talk to each other.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,040
Before we examine how they talk to each
other.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,200
We have to figure out how they talk,
period.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,420
And you, you could say, and I think that

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,720
most people understand that neurons talk
by using electrical signals.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,780
So you could say they, they tru, they talk
electrical-ese.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,740
But there's a really key difference
between the electrical

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,740
language of a neuron or of any living
cell.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,040
And the electrical language of one of your
devices,

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,990
one of your electrical devices at home or
here.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,220
So in, in an appliance in something that
you

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,050
plug into the wall, what we're using is
just electrons.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:06,480
In the living organism, we don't use
electrons.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,110
Instead, we use molecules that have a

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,070
charge and those molecules are called
ions.

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,470
So, ions are simply molecules where the
number

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,870
of protons is not equal to the number of
electrons.

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,560
Another way to think about this is, these

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,800
molecules have either, lost an electron or
two.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,640
Oops, lost that electron.

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,700
And now they're positively charged.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,020
Or they've gained one.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,780
One has come on to this, this molecule.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,220
And then they're negatively charged.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,460
So ions are either positively charged or
negatively

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,995
charged, just because they've either
gained or lost, electrons.

29
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:59,194
So these, these ions,

30
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,800
are present within the context of cells.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,740
And cells all have what are called
cellular membranes.

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:16,600
So a membrane is a, is a very amazing
structure that's made up mostly of fat.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,650
It's important to understand that most of
a membrane is fat.

34
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:32,430
And this is like a layer of oil surrounded
by a couple layers of water.

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,010
So here's inside the cell.

36
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,120
Here's outside the cell.

37
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,800
I've only detailed a small part of this.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,490
But this would continue all the way around
the cell.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,540
So, if I have a charged particle.

40
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,120
Let's consider an ion that's positively
charged.

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,900
And let's consider, consider one that's
potassium.

42
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,940
So, K plus equals a potassium ion.

43
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,390
Well, this potassium ion is very happy in
water.

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,080
But it can't get through oil.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,410
It's not going to pass through there.

46
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,330
So, it's going to bounce off this
membrane.

47
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,650
And the only way for it to get through, is
via

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,330
a special place, which is, which we're
going to call an ion channel.

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,050
Okay.

50
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,090
So, this is nothing, more fancy than

51
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,950
essentially a cat door for the potassium
ion.

52
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,530
This is a door.

53
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,090
This is the building.

54
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,030
And this is the only way in or out.

55
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,980
You cannot go through the walls.

56
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,660
You gotta go through a door.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,330
And the door is called an ion channel.

58
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:51,680
[COUGH] Now, how is the potassium going to
distribute across this membrane?

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,380
Well, the potassium has two [COUGH]
features.

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,710
One is a chemical.

61
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,910
It's, it's a molecule.

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,744
So, as a, as a chemical it's akin

63
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:11,630
to a food dye.

64
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,110
So, if I put a lot of blue dye here, and
there's no

65
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:21,300
blue dye here, well, the blue dye is going
to go that way.

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,270
Because the gradient is there's more here
than there.

67
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,210
In the end, if there's an open door, the

68
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,300
amount of blue dye everywhere is going to
be even.

69
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,160
So, the chemical force for this potassium
ion is to leave.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,070
Leave the cell.

71
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,560
But, on the other hand, this, the cell is
actually negatively charged.

72
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,950
And outside, this is 0.

73
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,240
It's, it's, it's like being ground.

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,880
It's grounded.

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
It's got a lightning rod there.

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,120
So, this is negatively charged and this is
0.

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,210
Well, the potassium ion is positive.

78
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,660
And so there's an electrical force that
goes inside the cell.

79
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,300
So, what, what happens?

80
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,770
Well, you, you cannot reason your way
through this.

81
00:05:20,244 --> 00:05:25,557
But very smart, physical chemists and

82
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:31,700
physicists worked out, how this went.

83
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:39,900
At what potential the chemical force and
the electrical force will be even.

84
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,440
And that is where the membrane is going to
sit.

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,420
Where the chemical force and the
electrical force are

86
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,660
even for every ion that we have to worry
about.

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,420
And we have to worry about three ions, the
potassium ion,

88
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,250
the sodium ion, which is also positively
charged, and chloride ion.

89
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:11,450
And once we take into consideration each
of these ions, what we see is that this

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:23,510
cell is going to sit at rest at about
negative 70 to negative 60 mV.

91
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,330
Millivolts being 1 1,000th of a volt.

92
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,420
Now we, all the time, we have batteries
that give us nine volts or a few volts.

93
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,430
Anyway, this is 1 1000th of a volt.

94
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,630
That doesn't sound like a lot of potential
voltage.

95
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:50,220
But you're talking about keeping it across
a, a very small distance.

96
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:57,430
And so, this is essentially like keeping a
lightning bolt an inch away from yourself.

97
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,730
This is a very an amazing structure.

98
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,790
It's a very powerful structure.

99
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,430
So, the bottom line is that at rest, what

100
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,240
we have is a distribution of these
different ions.

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,860
Based on their electrical and their

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,790
chemical, based on electrical and chemical
forces.

103
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,000
And, the result is, that this neuron is
going to

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,490
sit always at a negative potential, until
something happens.

105
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,520
And, that's what we're going to talk about
in the next segment.

106
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,382
