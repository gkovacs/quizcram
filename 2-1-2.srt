1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:05,501
Let's have a

2
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:11,495
little primer

3
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:16,170
for those of you who may

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,580
have forgotten some of these terms, what
various electrical terms mean.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,460
And so, let's consider

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,020
the water analogy.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,640
In fact, electricity is very much like
water for a lot of the terms.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,570
So, let's consider that we, we have a
landscape that's very flat.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,780
And there's a there's a river, or creek,
that's sitting here.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,710
If this is flat is the water going
anywhere?

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,200
Not so much.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,520
Because it, all of this water.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,030
Is at the same level, and at the same
level, it has the same potential.

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,740
And so, if the potential is, it, if
there's no

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,120
difference in their potential, then there
is also no current.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,505
But now let's imagine that we come up here
and we have a, an, a waterfall.

17
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:23,180
[SOUND] Now, there's going to be flow,
because we have a potential drop.

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,730
This has a higher potential than this has.

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,160
And water is going to go down.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,980
And you're going to have a current.

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,500
This, this potential drop will, will,
drive the current.

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,920
Okay, and then consider what would happen
eh, if we had a higher waterfall.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,140
Well, this would have a greater potential
than this would and we would have

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,140
more of a drop, more of a potential
difference and a higher current.

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,790
One last thing to consider If, if we now
look down on this, and

26
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,020
we push this water through a, an opening
that is this big.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,170
Versus an opening that is.

28
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,480
This big.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,960
What have we changed?

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, we've changed the resistance.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,220
Here, there's more resistance.

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,940
And so, the, the amount of water that goes
through there is going to be reduced.

33
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,970
The current is going to be reduced here.

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,570
And it will be greater in this larger
channel.

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,640
Electricity is just like that.

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,740
And the things that we have to worry

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,590
about when it comes to neuronal
communication is potential.

38
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,870
So, potential in this context means

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,150
what's the potential difference from
inside the cell to outside the cell,

40
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,950
and it's, it's negative, we'll say
negative 65 millivolts.

41
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,140
It varies, but around negative 65
millivolts.

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,550
And remember that a millivolt is one one
thousandth of a volt

43
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:18,200
and the, another thing

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,490
that we have to worry about is that we
remember that there are ion channels

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:28,340
that go and, and provide a way for ions to
go in and out of a cell

46
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,830
And as they go in and out of the cell,
they are carrying current.

47
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,262
And finally, this whole cell has a
resistance.

48
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:46,610
If none, none of the channels are open,
the resistance is very high, infinite.

49
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:53,770
But if there are, let's say, three
channels open, the resistance is high,

50
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,940
but it's and it's much lower if we now
open say 100 channels.

51
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,300
Okay?

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,950
So, those are the, within the context of a
neuron that's what we mean

53
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,280
when we talk about potential, there's
potential

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,720
difference across the membrane, across
this, from the

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,940
inside of the cell to the outside of the
cell, there's current that goes

56
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,960
through ion channels, and there is a

57
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,650
resistance between the inside of the cell
and

58
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,180
the outside of the cell.

59
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,960
