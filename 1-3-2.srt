[MUSIC].

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,590
There are four parts to neurons.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,920
Neurons have four parts.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,680
The first is the cell body or, or also
called

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,234
the soma and this is the part that all
cells have.

6
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:30,960
This is cell central,there's the nucleus
here with the DNA.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,590
This is like city hall,it's going to give
out all the orders.

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,470
There's a manufacturing plant here where
proteins are made.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,650
There is an energy a power plant here,so
this

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,440
is really the, the place that keeps the
cell going.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,020
It makes all the, the material for the
entire the entirety of,

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,534
of a neuron which can be, as we said in
the last segment, very, very long,very

13
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:08,360
large,so the cell body has coming out from
it a varie, a number of dendrites

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,280
and these dendrites branch and they
continue to branch and they can branch 2,

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,740
3, 4, 5 times and so that makes a tree,
which we call the dendritic arbor or the

16
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:28,890
dendritic tree and, these dendrites are
responsible for gathering in information.

17
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,000
They're the, they're the sentries,they're
the place where, they're

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,660
the ears of this, of the cell of the
neuron.

19
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,780
They're taking in all information,so
information, is going into the dendrites

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,889
into the cell body to a certain extent,but
really into the dendrites.

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,400
So what do we do with all that
information?

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,950
Well, the cell is going to, process it,
sum

23
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,370
it up, and then send it out, through one
axon.

24
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:02,230
There's one axon and while these dendrites
are very local, they're going to have

25
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,840
a, a local distribution, this axon can go
far, far distances

26
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,180
and so, this can go a meter easily,um,

27
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,060
so this is an axon, and it's going to
carry the information a,

28
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,010
along, the length of it,but, then, then
what?

29
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,570
So, you have to get to a terminal, which
is a communications center, which is

30
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,900
going to take that information and give it
to the next cell in line

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,980
and if we just blow up this area right
here, what we see is that there's a

32
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,440
synaptic terminal, which is separated by a
space and

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,010
then contacts another cell,so the
information transfer

34
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,930
is in this direction, from the axon to the
next

35
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,338
cell and this point of information
transfer is called the synapse.

36
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:02,890
This cell ,this second cell, the infer,
the,

37
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,060
the cell that the neuron is talking to can
be any of a variety of cell types.

38
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,510
It can be another neuron,so most of the
neurons

39
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,830
in the brain they just talk to other
neurons.

40
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,350
There is a little internal convers, a big
internal conversation going

41
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,205
on there,so neurons talk to neurons but
neurons also go talk to

42
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,740
muscles and neurons talk to glands and
neurons talk to the

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,615
cardiac to, to the heart, to the cardiac
muscle,um, and so on.

44
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:36,585
Okay,in the, in the next segment what
we're going to do is look at the variety

45
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:43,870
uh,I've drawn one cell and this but cells
look really different even

46
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,450
in the same place, they look really
different and we'll look at some of

47
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:54,976
the variety of, of neurons and talk a
little bit more about their uniqueness.
