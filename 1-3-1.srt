2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:15,376
So in this module we're going to meet the
stars of

3
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:19,214
the nervous system, and the stars of the
nervous system are neurons.

4
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,620
Neurons are really special.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,750
So, admittedly, I am a complete
neuro-chauvinist.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,640
But, I can tell you that, let's say

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,310
you've seen ten gastrointestinal cells,
you've seen em all.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,840
Let's say you've seen ten cardiomyocytes,
you've seen em all.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,850
Ten lung cells, liver cells, kidney cells,
etc.

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,670
Kind of pretty standard.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,110
There might five, ten different types but

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,220
after that you're, you're out of
variation.

13
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,390
Totally different story in the, in the
department of neurons.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,538
So, neurons are, are basically unique.

15
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:04,420
You could ca-, if you were a real lumper,
you

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,020
could categorize them into maybe a few
million different types.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,610
So, we are going to look at neurons in
some detail.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,569
Before, before we get into their
particular

19
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:26,700
appearance, let's just understand one of
the features that makes neurons so unique.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,410
And that is that they are the longest,
they can be the longest cell in the body.

21
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,470
So, our longest neuron is a neuron that
has a

22
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,160
process that starts at your big toe and
ends right here.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,800
In me, that's about five feet, one and a
half meters.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,530
In really tall people that can be six
feet, two meters.

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,700
So, that's a really long process.

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,080
There's no other ce, cell type in the

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,430
entire body that is that long or that
large.

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:07,212
Now, in the next segment, what we're
going to do is we're going to get the

29
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:13,893
vocabulary to understand the, the
individual uniqueness of of neurons.
