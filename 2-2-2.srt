2
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:13,700
Okay, so we

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,750
have an action potential coming down the
line, down the axon, and we have.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,060
Neurotransmitters that are packaged within
vesicles.

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,470
How we get those, the neurotransmitter out
of the vesicle and across,

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,270
out of the cell and able to go and effect
another cell.

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,990
Well to understand this we have to realize
that.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,160
There is a, there's a cell membrane, but
the cell

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,030
also has a lot of other membranes that are
inside.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,000
Inside in these things called organelles.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,920
So, for instance, there's a nuclear
envelope and nuclear membrane.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,140
There are mitochondria.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,620
These are the power houses of the cell.

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,780
There is endoplasmic particulum where all
the proteins are

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,030
made so the manufacturing cell center of
the cell.

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,030
There are endosomes and lysosomes, which
are basically the garbage

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,980
collectors of the cell, and all of these
are surrounded by.

18
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,160
Membranes.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,990
And so, in order and there are vesicles
that traffic the

20
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,450
proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum
out to the appropriate place.

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,850
So, some proteins are going to go to the
membranes.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,940
Some are going to go to these other
places.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,910
So

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,060
the fusion between two different
membranes,

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,240
between say the endoplasmic reticulum
membrane and

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,620
the membrane of a vesicle that's going to
traffic a protein to some place.

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,686
That happens all the time.

28
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,220
It happens constitutively.

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,770
And so our challenge, as a neuron, is to
stop that.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,010
We can't have these vesicles fusing with
the

31
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,570
plasma membrane, with the cell membrane
all the time.

32
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,330
That would be, that would not.

33
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,990
Work, what we want to do is we want to
make the

34
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,080
vesicle fuse to the membrane only when the
action potential arrives.

35
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,210
So the key to neurotransmitter release is
two things.

36
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,470
Number one, we're going to suppress
constitutive release.

37
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:42,530
Suppress constitutive or ongoing release
and

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,380
number two, we are going to link the
release that we want.

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,870
We are going to link release in the
synaptic terminal to the action potential.

40
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,380
So we are going to link release.

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,100
To the action potential.

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,830
And the way that we do that, first of all
there

43
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,200
is a molecule that suppresses constitutive
release within the synaptic terminal.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,150
So that's great, so that's done.

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,920
Now let's think about how do we link
release to the action potential.

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,930
Well, when the action potential comes
down, this the membrane

47
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,270
potential, remember that the membrane
potential, if this is zero ground,

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,950
the membrane potential's around negative
65 millivolts.

49
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,812
But.

50
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:38,380
In comes that action potential, and it
goes skyrocketing, and as

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,580
this potential increases, it opens a
particular type of ion channel that

52
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,080
lets in a for, we haven't talked about
this ion, but it's a very important ion.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
It let's in calcium ions.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,060
These are positively charged, they lost,
oops, forgot two

55
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,700
electrons, so they've got a, a two
positive charges.

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,760
And, these calcium ions are going to flood
in to

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,960
the synaptic terminal, and that is going
to trigger release.

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,190
The release that happens.

59
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,920
Of vesicles that contain neurotransmitters
is

60
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,220
only happens when the calcium
concentration increases.

61
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,040
And the calcium concentration only

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,060
increases when the action potential
arrives.

63
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,950
So now we have accomplished our goal.

64
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,820
We suppressed the constitutive release and
now we've,

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,170
we've linked the release to the action
potential.

66
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:44,320
And all that happens when the calcium
concentration increases is that this

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,510
vesicular membrane and the the cell
membrane.

68
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,690
They actually,.

69
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,740
They're not just close, they fuse and so
you get something that looks like this.

70
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:08,660
Calcium comes in and now these two touch
and then it looks something like this.

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,700
It opens, this joins and it opens and then
that goes

72
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,800
to a bigger opening and then they're just,
it's all one.

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,060
So now we've released neurotransmitter but
the

74
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,280
key point was that we didn't particularly

75
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,800
release, it's not like we pumped it out,
we simply fused the vesicle membrane.

76
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,810
To the cell membrane.

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,730
In the next segment we're going to look at

78
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:43,774
a very important drug that affects this
process.
