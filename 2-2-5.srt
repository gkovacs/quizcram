00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,499
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:15,379
Okay so we've almost come full circle.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,990
Now we've released a message from the

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,210
presynaptic terminal and the, the issue
here,

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,240
the, the next hurdle is to make

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,580
sure that the postsynaptic cell receives
that message.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,680
And it receives it.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,920
Through a type of protein.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,730
These are actually multi-protein complexes
called receptors and

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,780
receptors are going to populate this
post-synaptic

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,010
membrane so that as the neurotransmitter
makes its way across.

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:58,270
The synaptic cleft, some portion of it,
that which is not either diffused away,

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,660
taken back up through reuptake, or
degraded through enzymatic degradation.

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,180
So the, the survivors will actually make
it over to these receptors.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,630
Now let's just take a look at what the
receptors look like.

16
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,589
Here's the cell membrane.

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,770
And these are trans-membrane protein
complexes.

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,690
And they form an actual pore.

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,550
And through this pore the ions can, can
travel.

20
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,040
So the potassium ions can go out.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,240
The sodium ions can come in.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,870
Chloride ions can come in.

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,590
Things like that.

24
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:46,440
So normally, these receptors are closed,
ions can't come in.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,719
But when a neurotransmitter binds to the
receptor or a couple of neurotransmitter

26
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,450
molecules bind to the receptor, the
receptor's now going to open.

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:06,520
And the pore becomes available for as a
highway for the ions to travel along.

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,310
And which way they travel depends on the
type of receptor.

29
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,290
And so, as it turns out, we have two basic
classes of receptors.

30
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,340
There are receptors that we, that have an
excitatory an, effect.

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,870
And so, once again, if we return to our,
our cell,

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,370
which is sitting at negative 65
millivolts.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,260
We, any receptor, that takes the membrane
potential

34
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,270
closer to zero, and closer to this magical

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,240
place that is the threshold for an action
potential.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,480
If you go closer to that, that's an
excitatory receptor.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,030
On the other hand, if there is a a, a
receptor

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,370
that actually takes the membrane potential
away

39
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,210
from zero, makes it even more negative.

40
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,980
Then this is taking us away from the
threshold for the action potential.

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,250
And so that is an inhibitory,

42
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,720
receptor.

43
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,370
So they come in two flavors, and, the

44
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,800
most ubiquitous excitatory receptor is a
glutamate receptor.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,910
And the most ubiquitous inhibitory
receptor is a GABA receptor.

46
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,620
The neutrotransmitter involved is the same
thing.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,170
So the neutrotransmitter involved in the,
that binds to the

48
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,100
inhibitory GABA receptor is a GABA recept,
is a GABA molecule.

49
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,250
And the neurotransmitter that binds to

50
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,750
the excitatory glutamate receptor is
glutamate.

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,770
Okay, so that's how these, these receptors
receive the message.

52
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,240
and, and they integrate all this incoming
information to either.

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,460
Make it more likely for them to fire an

54
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,440
action potential or less likely to fire an
action potential.

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,150
If they're more likely, if this cell has
an action potential, and it results in

56
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,330
this cell also firing an action potential,
then we've got a game of telephone.

57
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,310
A tag.

58
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,190
And that's, that's how the, the nervous

59
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,940
system, and that's how communication
between neurons happens.

60
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,950
Throughout the, the nervous system.

61
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,770
Now let's, let's think about, what impact

62
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,720
these receptors have on disease and
therapeutics.

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,090
So, one impact is there are diseases where
we lose

64
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,680
these receptors and one such disease is
called myasthenia gravis.

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,130
We mentioned this in the last segment.

66
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,239
So in myasthenia gravis, let's walk over
here to this lovely image.

67
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:21,580
[COUGH] this is a, an image from a human.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,880
Here is a motoneuron synaptic terminal.

69
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,810
And you can see these little synaptic
vesicles.

70
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,900
Okay?

71
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,700
And so all those synaptic vesicles contain

72
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,900
acetyl choline, which we will abbreviate
as ACh.

73
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,690
And over here is the muscle.

74
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,130
The muscle is a very, it, it has

75
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,340
this convoluted appearance where it has
these folds.

76
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,960
And it, it doesn't, that doesn't
particularly matter.

77
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:03,650
But what you see in black, all this black,
these are acetylcholine receptors.

78
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,880
And the acetylcholine has to make it
across

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,140
this cleft to get to the acetylcholine
receptors.

80
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:20,100
In myasthenia gravis, there are antibodies
that, that the body makes.

81
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,060
Unfortunately, by mistake, against these
acetyl, acetyl choline receptors.

82
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,219
And so the antibodies.

83
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,090
Destroy the acetyl receptors, the muscle
doesn't eat,

84
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,750
either has fewer or they're just not
concentrated.

85
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,460
And therefore this this signal is sent

86
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,965
from the motor neuron terminal, but it's
not

87
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:52,740
received by the muscle, and so at again,
as we talked about in the last segment.

88
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,340
What do we do about that?

89
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,060
Well we, we rely on the fact that there
are a few acetylcholine receptors that

90
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,920
have escaped being killed by the
antibodies and

91
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,680
so we just try and boost this signal.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,830
We know that the motor neuron terminal can

93
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,940
release acetylcholine and now we're
going to stop degradation.

94
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,060
We're going to give an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to try

95
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,350
and keep the acetylcholine around longer
so that it

96
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,170
can find its way to the few remaining

97
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,460
acetylcholine receptors and that's a, a
pretty effective therapeutic.

98
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,040
The other therapeutic, obviously that
people with mycenia gravis

99
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,250
get is, let's, let's dampen down that
immune system,

100
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,230
so that you're not making all those
antibodies so

101
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:47,010
that the acetylcholine receptors won't be
won't be degraded.

102
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:55,560
And so there's immuno suppressants that
are given to these patients as well.

103
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,800
