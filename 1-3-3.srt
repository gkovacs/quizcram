1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,330
So, let's talk about what makes neurons
unique.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,370
And here, I, I really apologize in
advance.

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,070
I'm going to show you pictures.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,250
Of neurons that, that I filled and
stained.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,500
And these neurons are actually, they're
sort of like members of my family.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,930
For instance, this neuron right here, I
have incredibly deep, fond feelings for.

8
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:43,890
So, yeah I understand that not maybe
everyone feels that way but,

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,634
indulge me for a moment, we're going to
look at a few pictures.

10
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:55,240
so, here is a neuron and this piece right
here is the cell body,

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,530
these are the dendrites They you can see
that they divide, they divide a few times.

12
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,970
We not the whole, the whole thing's not in
focus,

13
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,510
we're going to see later a reconstruction
of this lovely cell.

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,680
Okay so that's the dendrites and then
here, this

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,510
is the axon and you can see that the, now

16
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm going to take away these lines, you
can see

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,600
that the axon has a different appearance
from the dendrites.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,350
The dendrites have their own appearance.

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,820
Now I'm going to show you another cell.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,280
My feelings are not quite as deep for this
cell, but it's a nice cell.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,840
So here's a cell and here is the cell
body.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,220
These are dendrites, you can see and
they're dividing, like this.

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,750
Here's a dendrite, dendrites, etc.

24
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,670
And you can see that the, the appearance
of this

25
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,960
cell is very different from the appearance
of the last cell.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,150
Now we're going to see a, a
reconstruction.

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,690
What I did was I actually drew out the
entire cell.

28
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,900
And we're going to look at a few
reconstructions and we're going to

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,880
see, once again, that there's great
variety in how these neurons look.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,310
And all of these neurons, that I'm showing
you, are all in the same nucleus.

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,250
They're in the same location.

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,330
They got the same address, but they look
really different.

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,200
If you have the same address and you're in
the lung, you are not looking different.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,860
So, this is really what's really, really
different about neurons.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,450
Neurons are very unique.

36
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,854
Very, very unique is a little bit of a of
a toxism but they are, they are unique.

37
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:32,130
and, and unlike cells of other organs.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,710
Ok, so here's a, a reconstruction.

39
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,190
And this line here, that's got the arrows
on it.

40
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,460
That's the axon.

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,730
The rest of this is the dendritic arbor.

42
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,290
And you can see that the dendritic arbor
gives you an area.

43
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,730
This is where the neuron is collecting
information from.

44
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,080
Okay?

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,410
So, the dendrites are taking information
in and this entire arbor,

46
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,190
describes a volume from which the neuron
will listen to information.

47
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,370
Here's a different looking cell.

48
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,620
This is, in fact, my, my deeply fond cell,
451.

49
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,450
Hm.

50
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,020
Okay, so here's the cell, and it's a
beautiful cell.

51
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,690
It's got this, it's got a very large,
dendritic arbor.

52
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,240
It's listening to a lot of cells.

53
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:35,400
And, and then it also has an axon which is
not shown on this, reconstruction.

54
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,040
And finally there's, here's a, a very
simple cell.

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,770
This is a cell, actually, that contains
the neurotransmitter serotonin.

56
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,130
And these other, the other calls did

57
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,330
not contain serotonin, they contained
other neurotransmitters.

58
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,520
And you can see in this reconstruction,
it's a pretty simple cell.

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,000
There are only two primary dendrites, and
they only divide a, a few times.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,980
So the, there's not that huge arbor.

61
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,430
There's not that very delicate or
elaborated arbor.

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,470
I've spent my scientific life, staining
cells in one place, in one

63
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,950
nucleus and that nucleus tends to have, or
has, cells that are fairly simple.

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,720
In contrast, we know that there are other
cells that are very

65
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,560
complex, and this is one that I, I thank
Giorgio Grasselli for.

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,940
This is a purkinje cell in the cerebellum,
and you can

67
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,750
see that it has elaborate, it has a very
elaborate dendritic arbor.

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,890
Each one of these dendrites has actually
little, protuberances

69
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,052
called spines and that's what makes it
look really hairy.

70
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,337
The cells that I filled don't have spines
and here's

71
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:53,720
the axon for the cell, it's going to go
down like this.

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,970
So it's collecting information up here in
the

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,030
arbor and it's sending information down
like that.

74
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,630
In addition to variety in the size and the
shape of the soma,

75
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,572
the cell body, as well as the dendrites,
there's variety in the axon.

76
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:12,620
And so, I'm just going to show you these
pictures.

77
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,840
If they speak to you, fabulous.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,410
If they don't, that, that's okay too.

79
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,830
So here's the, you can see the out of

80
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,630
focus, this is the axon, it's the parent
axon.

81
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:29,170
And it gives off branches or collaterals
and on these collaterals

82
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,700
are little, little swellings and these are
all synaptic terminals.

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,550
So that's what this, that's what the words
that

84
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,600
I have used, that's what it really looks
like.

85
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,020
Here is another, this is a different
appearance.

86
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,440
So here is the axon.

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,360
This is the axon and you can see that it
gives off these little, terminals

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,810
and it also has places where there's just
simply a swelling, on root.

89
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,754
So these are all synaptic, this a synaptic
terminal,

90
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:07,100
this is a synaptic terminal, this is an
axon.

91
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,230
So what we've just looked at is a wide
variety of ways in

92
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,500
which the anatomy of different neurons
can,

93
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,630
can make them different from each other.

94
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,570
And the anatomy is different in
appearance, but it's also

95
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,760
different in the sense of, what is a
neuron connected to?

96
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,310
What neurons are talking to it and what
neurons is it talking to?

97
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,390
So the inputs and the outputs of each
neuron are going to be different.

98
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,760
They're either going to be very, very
different or slightly different.

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,910
In addition to the anatomy, it's, the

100
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,590
other differences include the, what we
call excitability.

101
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,900
And this is essentially, how talkative is
the neuron?

102
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,690
How much do you have to goad it to get it
to say something?

103
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,510
And some neurons are, you know, they're
talking all the time.

104
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,388
And some neurons are very laconic, very
unlikely to speak.

105
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:08,110
And so, whether a neuron is, is, is very,

106
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,150
very likely or very unlikely to fire
action potentials, this is

107
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,450
a, another way in which different neurons,
are different from each other.

108
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,730
And finally there's, how do they speak?

109
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,820
And what we're talking about is the
neurotransmitter.

110
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,315
What is the neurotransmitter or what's the

111
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,210
chemical, the substance that the neuron
uses?

112
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,940
And we saw one neuron there that was using
serotonin.

113
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,770
But other neurons use other
neurotransmitters.

114
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,565
And we can think about this rather than go
through the different

115
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:49,490
neurotransmitters, we can think about this
as what, what can you say?

116
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,670
Well some neurons can say yes, yes, yes,
yes.

117
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,400
Some neurons say no, no, no, no.

118
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,810
Some neurons kind of hem and haw before
they say

119
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,750
maybe, probably, or questionable.

120
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,070
So there is a difference in both speed,
whether is something's fast

121
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,990
or slow, or also whether it's affirmative
or or negative.

122
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,660
So yes or no and how, how fast does it

123
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,200
take you to get to yes or no, versus
negative?

124
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,840
Neurons differ in all these various ways
and that's why neurons,

125
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,890
to me, they're as different as all the
stars in the sky.

126
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,620
Everyone's its own, its own self.

127
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,450
In the next segment, we're going to look
at the support staff.

128
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,620
What enables neurons to, to shine like the
stars in the sky?

129
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,850
And, and they need a lot of support and
we'll meet that support staff in

130
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,890
the next segment.
