2
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,315
So we are going to talk about brain
tumors.

3
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:20,080
But before we talk about brain tumors,
let's talk about the basics of cancer.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,060
In cancer there is a primary tumor.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,470
So let's say that you have a, a tumor in
your colon.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,140
That means that a colon cell is dividing,
and dividing,

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,750
and dividing, and instead of stopping, it
keeps on dividing.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,580
It becomes immortal.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,520
It's just going to divide without any
limits.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,970
And because it keeps on dividing, it keeps
on growing, it gets bigger and bigger.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,050
And if that's all that were going to
happen, that would

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,340
be okay, because we'd go in, and we'd take
it out.

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,950
But that's not all that happens.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,710
What happens in cancer is that, that one
of those cells decides to

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,010
go rogue, or few of those cells decide to
go rogue and they travel some place else.

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,600
And then they start a new tumor elsewhere.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,000
So they metastasize.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,370
They spread.

19
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,510
So, the cell that or tumor starts in the
colon, and then

20
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,560
a few cells float off to some other place,
and now all of

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,870
a sudden, you've got tumors that are in
your bones, or tumors

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,090
that are in your lungs, and maybe even a
tumor in your brain.

23
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,260
Same thing with breast cancer or lung
cancer,

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,040
it starts in one place, it starts in

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,950
the breast or it starts in the lung, but
from there it can spread to other organs.

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,870
So, one source of brain tumors is
metastasis spreads from

27
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,790
other or, from other tumors, so for
instance lung tumors.

28
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,150
The metastasis are a problem and actually
the brain tumors are a problem because

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,210
they exist within the cranium, and the
cranium is a fixed, bony container.

30
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,100
It can't expand.

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,140
And as a tumor expands, the, the cranium
is not going to expand.

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,380
It's going to increase the pressure and
we're going to have a problem.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,302
Okay, so besides having tumors that spread
from other

34
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:20,158
organs, what are the other sources of
brain tumors?

35
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:25,739
Well, one of the very consistent things
about neurons is that they don't divide.

36
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,560
They are what's called, they are, they are
at the end of their line.

37
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,660
They have no descendants.

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,530
Once a neuron is born, it lives and it
dies and when it dies, that's the end.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,120
It doesn't, it cannot replace itself, and,
and that's the end.

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,330
So neurons don't make tumors because they
don't divide

41
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,140
at all, and they don't get into this
uncontrolled division.

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,520
So what makes tumors?

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,020
Well, it's other cell types within the
brain.

44
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,474
And the primary one that does this are
glial cells.

45
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:06,262
So glial cells don't have the limits on
division that neurons do.

46
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:10,450
So, glial cells can divide and make these
tumors.

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,630
And and so, glials, gliomas, tumors of
glial

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,150
cells, are the most common type of brain
tumor.

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,110
Another type of brain tumor are,

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,450
is the type that comes from a division

51
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,800
of meningeal cells, and these are called
meningiomas.

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,570
Remember that we have the pia, the
arachnoid, and the dura.

53
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,190
These are meningeal cells that cover the
brain and if they start to divide

54
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,000
once again they're going to make a
space-occupying

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,570
tumor that's going to increase pressure
within the skull.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,570
And finally, the other major type of brain
tumor

57
00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:00,680
is are tumors that come from glandular
cells.

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,230
Now, you might think, well, the glandular
cells, I've

59
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,780
got glands here, and I've got glands under
my armpit.

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,670
I've got glands at various places.

61
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,510
But do I really have glands in my head?

62
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,800
Well, it turns out you have two glands in
your head.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,370
One is right here, and that one is called
the pineal gland.

64
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,210
You may have heard it, heard of it,
because it makes melatonin.

65
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,290
Melatonin might help you sleep.

66
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,940
And the pineal gland is, is important for

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,330
the daily rhythm of, of waking and
sleeping.

68
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,850
And this, these glandular cells are not
neurons.

69
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,970
They're, they're gland cells, and they can

70
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,890
become, they can divide without, without
control.

71
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,970
The other, gland that we have in our head
is, is one that sits right here.

72
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,130
It's not actually on this picture, but
it's called the pituitary,

73
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,480
and these pituitary cells can also divide
and that's called pituitary adenomas.

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,200
These pituitary adenomas are fairly
common.

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,090
They account for about 10 to 25% of
inter-cranial tumors.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,270
Okay, so bottom line is, brain tumors are
a problem because they take up space.

77
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,650
Brain tumors are not tumors of neurons,
they're

78
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,920
tumors of glial cells, meningeal cells, or
glandular

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,110
cells, or they are metastasis spread from
other

80
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,070
organs such as the colon or the lung.

81
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay.

82
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,550
That's it for this week.

83
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,830
I, I bet you've learned a lot!

84
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,368
In the next segment, I'm going to
introduce the topics

85
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,852
that we're going to cover in the rest of
this course.

86
