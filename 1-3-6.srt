[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,570
So remember that the allele

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,430
cells that make the myelin, there
different types

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,700
that make it in the central nervous system
and in the peripheral nervous system.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,020
And because of that, people get a
demyelinating disease, get it either in

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,010
the central nervous system, or in the

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,750
peripheral nervous system, but not in
both.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,430
So the problem is either in the
oligodendrocytes and

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,550
that, and the interaction between the
oligodendrocytes and the axon.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,250
In which case, you get a central
Demyelinating disease,

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,270
and the most common by far is multiple
sclerosis.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,330
Or, there's a problem in the Schwann cell
and its connection to the axon.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,250
And in that case, you can get a variety,
There are a group of,

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,465
a diverse group of hereditar, hereditary
neuropathies called Charcot–Marie–Tooth.

15
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:15,810
These are Demyelinating diseases that
typically are, they are

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,030
inherited and they typically progress and
become worse with time.

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,230
There's also an acute demyelinating
disease

18
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,120
called Guillain-Barre which typically has
a very

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,450
quick onset, it's inflammatory, and,
luckily, it, it goes away after a while.

20
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,310
So, what are the symptoms?

21
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,660
Well, the symptoms from, it, from our
perspective or the symptoms is that the

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,742
neural code is disrupted anywhere there is
Demyelination.

23
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:53,350
So, the Demyelination in the puriferal
nervous system is mostly going to affect

24
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,640
motor axons, because they conduct at they
transfer information the fastest.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,560
So these are going to have a lot of motor
symptoms, but once we

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,930
go to the Central Nervous System, there
are axons all over, there are myelinated

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,040
axons all over that do all manner of
things and the symptoms that

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,790
a person gets, with Multiple Sclerosis
will

29
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,630
entirely depend on which axons are
affected.

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,800
Now there are external groups that are
more typically

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,604
effected than others in multiple
Sclerosis, but there is no,

32
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,420
there is no group that's always affected
and there is

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,354
no group that's immune from the effects
from multiple Sclerosis.

34
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:40,660
So the effect of Multiple Sclero,
Sclerosis are

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,250
at a basic level to disrupt the neural
code.

36
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,800
But the actual symptoms that will result
from that

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,670
disruption, are going to be individual
across, across the group.

38
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,560
Okay, so in the next module, what we're
going to do is

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,940
we're going to, clarify this difference
between the central nervous system and

40
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,530
the peripheral nervous system.

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,020
