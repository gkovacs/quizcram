[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,134
Okay, so what locked-in syndrome, the

3
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:20,390
locked-in syndrome that, that Jean
Dominique Bauby suffered from.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,020
It tells us about the four basic functions

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,078
of the brain, of the central nervous
system.

6
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:33,620
And those are; voluntary movement,
perception, homeostasis and

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,350
something that is oddly described as
abstract or higher functions, cognition.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,920
There are a lot of words for this, none of
them exactly perfect.

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,560
Okay.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,880
So, let's just go through what these
various functions mean.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,010
So, voluntary movement is everything that
we do.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,020
And, when I say voluntary, I kind of mean
voluntary, and I kind of don't.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,970
What I mean is something that is driven by
the brain.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,180
And that can be something that

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,930
I do completely volitionally, completely
deliberately.

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,130
Like I say, I'm going to raise my hand,
and I raise my hand.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,240
That's a voluntary volitional movement.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,670
But, if I step on something and I wince in
pain.

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,880
That's an emotional movement.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,710
Both of them, are, we're classifying for
right now as voluntary movements.

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,060
They're self generated.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,250
They are, they come from ourselves.

23
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,630
And these voluntary movements are the only
way that we have to express ourselves.

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,020
I know that in the popular press there

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,590
is a difference between words and, and,
and actions.

26
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,580
Sticks and stones can break my bones but
words can never hurt me.

27
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,770
Well actions and, and talk, talk and

28
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,450
actions, they're, they're all, they're all
one action.

29
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,930
[LAUGH] So talk is an action, and we use
are laryngeal muscles.

30
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,910
Our diaphragm our the, the muscles of the

31
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,790
upper airway including their tongue, and
pharyngeal muscles.

32
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,150
These are all muscles that we use to
actually express ourselves.

33
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,000
So, talking, writing.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,060
Having a facial expression.

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,460
Raising your hand.

36
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,850
Jumping up and down.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,790
Doing a new da, dance step.

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,630
All of these are voluntary movements, and
these were

39
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,350
definitely lost in Bauby, all he could do
and

40
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,850
all many of people in, with locked in
syndrome

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,770
can do is, is more their [UNKNOWN] an
eyelid.

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,590
Okay.

43
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,120
So that's voluntary movement.

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,620
Perception, is distinct from sensation.

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,460
And that's a very important, concept.

46
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,110
Perception is what we consciously
appreciate about sensation.

47
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,450
So, what, I sense all sorts of stuff that
I have no perception about.

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,980
So, for instance.

49
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,793
My brain senses how much CO2 there is in
my blood.

50
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:11,710
Well, [UNKNOWN] I have no idea how much
CO2 there is in my blood.

51
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,910
I mean, I could take a guess.

52
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,200
But, that's because I'm a scientist, and I
kind of know how much there should be.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,850
but, but there's all the, there, there's
sensors that tell

54
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,570
us how long our muscles are, where our,
our joints are.

55
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,770
None of that actually reaches conscious
perception.

56
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,950
The perception is that, that we have our
include vision and hearing,

57
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,910
smell and taste, the sense of balance, the
sense of position in the world.

58
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,740
Where are we?

59
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,850
Where is our head in the world?

60
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,760
A sense of equilibrium.

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,520
All of those are perceptions that we have.

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,510
They actually reach conscious, a conscious
level.

63
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,300
The third function major function, that
we're going to talk about, is homeostasis.

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,180
And homeostasis is what we use to keep our
body in physiological limits.

65
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,890
To make sure that we have enough oxygen to
our brain, and to the rest of our body.

66
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,960
We are going to focus very much on brain
[LAUGH] in this course.

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,600
so, we have to make sure that the, that,
that there's enough oxygen

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,250
delivered to the body, that there's enough
blood pressure that keeps us upright.

69
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,430
We have to make sure that our body
temperature stays within limits.

70
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,270
The physiological limits that the body
will tolerate.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,540
We there are life cycle events that are
challenges to our, our being.

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,610
And these include giving birth, and
nursing a newborn, suckling from a mother.

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,010
All of these things are part of
homeostasis.

74
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,450
They're part of the package that keeps us
alive.

75
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,290
Another part of homeostasis is a rhythm.

76
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,230
The rhythm of our lives.

77
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,420
The daily rhythm.

78
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,320
The wake and the sleep.

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,080
And the seasonal rhythm.

80
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,920
Rhythm, the seasonal rhythm that has a
little bit less

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,280
of an obvious influence on us than, the
daily rhythm.

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,590
And then, the cycle of life.

83
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,350
So we go from infancy, to childhood, to
adolescence.

84
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,370
To early adulthood, to middle age, to
being older.

85
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,770
And so, these are all part of homeostasis.

86
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,180
It's all part of the challenge of staying
alive, and as far as abstract functions,

87
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,760
these are things like thinking, and
feeling emotions, and motivation.

88
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,660
And language, and memory, and learning.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,240
All of these are part of our higher
abstract functions.

90
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,200
Another incredibly important abstract
function, is how we interact.

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,220
How, how do we play well with others?

92
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,420
How do we get in that sandbox and, and,
and survive it?

93
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,210
So these are all part of abstract
functions.

94
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,200
And they're a very important part of being
a, a human.

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,550
So, in the next segment, what we're
going to do is, we're going to

96
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,910
assign each one of these functions to a
part of the central nervous

97
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,250
system.

98
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,310
