2
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:18,447
So what we talked about in the last
segment was how neurons sit at, at

3
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:24,125
a resting membrane potential of about
negative 65 millivolts.

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:28,095
And through mechanisms that we're going to
come to.

5
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:33,293
That resting membrane potential is just
sort of the

6
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:39,380
it's the potential around which the neuron
oscillates.

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,860
So, at, at one point it might get an input
that.

8
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,142
If this is 0, that brings it closer to

9
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:53,780
0 or takes it farther away from 0, et
cetera.

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,850
And these small little potential
differences, which are on the

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,090
order of less than one millivolt up to,
say, five millivolts.

12
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:12,420
These small, little potential differences,
can travel, along the neuron.

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,650
If this is, if these are the dendrites
and, and here's an axon.

14
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,460
They might travel, but they're going to
peter out pretty quickly.

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,370
So, it's not a a useful it's not going to

16
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,980
work to simply rely on these small
potential changes.

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,440
Now if we have to go long distances.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,964
Now, one of the things that is so
different about a neuron than

19
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:44,906
any other cell type in the body is that we
are, that these neurons.

20
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:47,950
We [LAUGH] meet a neuron.

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,760
Neurons are very long.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,410
Okay.

23
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,340
So think about a heart cell.

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,960
A heart cell is so big, it's contained in

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,080
the heart, it ain't going anywhere,
besides the heart.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,630
A pancreatic cell is sitting in the
pancreas, it's in the pancreas.

27
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,910
It's pretty small.

28
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,930
A lung cell, et cetera.

29
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,160
Now, let's think about the longest neuron
that we posses.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,230
The longest neuron that we possess is a
cell that has a cell body right here.

31
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,610
And it sends one process all the way down
to the toe, and it

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,230
sends another process all the way up to
the medulla.

33
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,555
So, depending on how tall this person is.

34
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:41,050
In me, that's a, one and a half meters,
say, so five feet or something like that.

35
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,780
But in a very tall person, or even in

36
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,030
a very short person, that's still a lot of
feet.

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,400
That's feet long.

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,230
So, a small potential like one millivolt
or five millivolts is not going to travel.

39
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,260
If that's what we had to rely on, just
moving from here

40
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,410
to here, the message, any message that
started here would end there.

41
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,360
It just wouldn't get there.

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,070
It wouldn't get to where it needs to go.

43
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,840
It needs to go here.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,350
And so, in order to, to communicate within
neurons,

45
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,300
because neurons are so long, we use
something called the Action Potential.

46
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,960
And the Action Potential, in contrast to
being this, this kind of small thing, is.

47
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,758
It goes really far up and comes back down,
so it's

48
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,378
about 100 millivolts in, in height.

49
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,820
So from the resting memory potential to
the top of the

50
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,940
Action Potential, which happens at around
plus say, 20 millivolts or so.

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,070
It's, we're talking about roughly 100
millivolts of, of difference.

52
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,790
And that can get communicated all the way
up.

53
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,030
That's not going to get lost.

54
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,190
And what carries that Action Potential, is
that.

55
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,230
Remember that we, we, we looked at
potassium being very

56
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,490
high in a cell and much lower outside a
cell.

57
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,430
Well, the reverse is true for sodium.

58
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,879
And so, the sodium comes flooding in, and
because it's positively charged,

59
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:36,277
that's what takes the, the cell up to this
very high memory potential.

60
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:42,985
Now the the ability for, for a neuron to
communicate from

61
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:49,390
here to here using an Action Potential is,
it can do that.

62
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,394
But that'll be a slow process unless we
add

63
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:59,815
one more thing, and that is a, an
insulator,

64
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:05,902
essentially a very nice insulator called
myelin.
