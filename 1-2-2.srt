2
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:16,690
So in this segment we're going to map
these four basic functions

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,802
onto the brain, onto the central nervous
system, I should say.

4
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:25,065
So if we come over here, what we see is
what you would find if

5
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:31,000
you opened up the skull and you were
looking at the brain from the side.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,610
So, this is the back, this is the front,
and this entire,

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,880
everything that you see here, all of this,
this is the forebrain.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,030
It's all that you can see from the
outside, from the side.

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,340
Back here, this is part of the brain stem.

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,190
It's actually a part that's called the
cerebellum.

11
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,560
So, this is part of the brain stem and
then if

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,389
we follow this further back, we would get
to the spinal cord.

13
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,980
Now, the separation between the brain and
the spinal cord is

14
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,820
the, the brain is contra, is contained in
the skull,

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,030
and then there's an opening in the skull
called the

16
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,490
foramen magnum where the brain actually
attaches to the spinal cord.

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,020
And the spinal cord is contained in a

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,070
different set of bones called the
vertebral column.

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,340
Okay.

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,920
So now what we're going to do is we're
going to take a view from

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,920
the middle of the brain and we're going to
look at the medial surface.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,700
We're going to, we're going to cut like
this

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,140
and look into the middle of the brain.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,560
So here we have a brain and once again we

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,380
see this, this appearance that we saw from
the outside.

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,480
This is part of the forebrain.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,360
In fact, the forebrain goes all the way
through here.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,920
All of this is forebrain.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,440
This back here is brain stem.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,940
And

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,810
it's split into a hindbrain, which is all
of this and a mid brain.

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,160
We'll look at that more later.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,370
But this entire bit, the mid brain and the
hind brain,

34
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,545
is the brain stem and back here is the
spinal cord.

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,980
So where do these four different

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,235
functions, where do they map onto?

37
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:41,040
Well, let's start with mo, with voluntary
movements.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,710
Now voluntary movements means moving your
skeletal muscle, your voluntary muscles.

39
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,500
And there's only one neuron type that
leave the central nervous system

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,670
and goes directly to muscles, and that's
the, that's the motor neuron.

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,200
And there aren't very many of them.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,370
There's under a hundred thousand, out of

43
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,180
200 billion neurons in the central nervous
system.

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,330
So, they're rare.

45
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,740
They're a very special type of neuron.

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,850
If they die, you can no longer move that
muscle.

47
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,780
Now, where are the motor neurons?

48
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,720
The motor neurons are contained either in
the brain stem or in the spinal cord.

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,632
But, there are no motor neurons in the
forebrain.

50
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:29,100
So the neur, motor neurons in the brain
stem move the face, move the mouth,

51
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,810
move the larynx, and are responsible for

52
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,350
speech and swallowing, facial expressions,
things like that.

53
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,810
The motor neurons in the spinal cord are
responsible for doing all this stuff.

54
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,580
All of our arms, our legs, our trunk, all
of our

55
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,890
movement that we do with our body happens
through the spinal cord.

56
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,190
Perception, remember that perception is
the

57
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,040
conscious perception of, of sensory
inputs,

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,080
the conscious appreciation of sensory
inputs,

59
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,270
and that depends entirely on the
forebrain.

60
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,450
In fact, the appreciation of sensory
inputs, the conscious

61
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,210
appreciation of sensory inputs depends on
the cerebral cortex.

62
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,050
All of this, all of these hills and

63
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,270
valleys, this entire surface, is all
cerebral cortex.

64
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,220
This is what is required for perception.

65
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,310
If you don't make it up to cerebral

66
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,070
cortex, there is no perception that can
occur.

67
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,470
Okay?

68
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,390
So the information can come in through the

69
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,115
spinal cord, through the brain stem, even
through the

70
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,000
forebrain, but it has to make it to

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,510
this area, to this cerebral cortex, this
outer mantle.

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,605
Homeostasis is a very distributed process.

73
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:50,120
It depends on the forebrain, it depends on
the

74
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,610
brain stem, and it depends on the spinal
cord.

75
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,100
So up in forebrain, the contribution to
homeostasis is hormonal.

76
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,580
In brain stem, the, in the brain stem, the
contribution is, is varied.

77
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:13,040
It's, it's both through autonomic

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,040
changes, automatic changes that we're not
conscious of and we don't consciously

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,160
control, as well as consciously made
movements, and the

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,310
same is true for the, for the spinal cord.

81
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,522
And finally, higher abstract functions
depend entirely on the forebrain.

82
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,680
That's, that's all, they all take place.

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,940
It's like cog wheels just running around
in the forebrain.

84
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,468
So, even if you didn't have the brain stem
and the spinal cord, if

85
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,673
you could keep this forebrain alive, the

86
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:48,670
thoughts and emotions could, could turn
their wheels.

87
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,280
So, higher abstract functions are a, are a
outcome of,

88
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,100
of this, this same cerebral cortex that is
required for perception.

89
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,180
And in fact, perception is one of the
higher abstract functions

90
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,720
that we have, but we're also going to look
at it separately.

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,380
Okay, so what we have is different ca,
capacities in the different areas.

92
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,730
The forebrain is critical to higher
function,

93
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,480
language, memory, emotion, thought, all of
that.

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,960
Brain stem and spinal cord are a little
bit

95
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,820
of a mix and match where they're very good
doers.

96
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,838
They can, they can move and they are
pathways for ascending, for

97
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:41,557
incoming sensory input, as well as for
outgoing homeostatic adjustments.

98
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,960
In the next segment, what we're going to
look at is

99
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,582
how the nervous system partners with the
periphery to produce functions.
