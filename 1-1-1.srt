00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:15,660
Hi everyone, and welcome to Understanding
the Brain.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,300
We're going to talk about the neurobiology
of everyday life.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,120
I'm really excited about this.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,390
I've learned so much by preparing for this
class

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,220
and I think that we're going to learn a
lot

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,150
as we, as you go along in this class and
as we talk to each other every week.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,538
Just to give you an overview of what we're
going to concern ourselves

9
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:40,452
with, I want to share with you a story
which is, really shows the

10
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:45,408
power and the profundity of what our
nervous system does for us.

11
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:48,334
And the story is by Jean-Dominique Bauby
and

12
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,560
it's called The Diving Bell and the
Butterfly.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,588
Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor of

14
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,977
ELLE, the leading fashion magazine in
France.

15
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:04,240
And he lived in Paris and he lived a very
exciting cosmopolitan life.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,270
He had two children.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,070
And one day, he was driving and he had a
sudden onset

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,580
incapacitation.

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,540
It turned out to be a stroke, a massive
stroke in his brain stem.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,550
He, he says in the beginning of the
prologue before

21
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,270
this happened, he'd never even heard of
the brain stem.

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,390
Well, you're going to hear about the brain
stem.

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,520
So he had this massive stroke in the brain
stem and this left him paralyzed.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,430
So he couldn't move his arms or his legs.

25
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,110
He couldn't point.

26
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,740
He was on a respirator because he could
not breathe on his own.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,430
He couldn't swallow.

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,804
So he was they had to deal with him
drooling.

29
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:53,644
At one point in, in this book, which I'll
tell

30
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:56,413
you how he wrote in a minute he says, he
was

31
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:59,395
very happy to get his own clothes back
because if he

32
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:02,530
had to drool he at least wanted to drool
on cashmere.

33
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,510
So so what, how did he write this book?

34
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,110
He's paralyzed.

35
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,640
He can't write.

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,020
He can't speak.

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,140
He's on a respirator.

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,800
He can't move his laryngeal muscles, he
can't

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,680
really form his upper airway to form
words.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,840
So how did he do it?

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Well, it turns out that people with this
syndrome, and

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,120
it's called the Locked-in syndrome, often
times can move an eyelid.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,930
And indeed he could move an eyelid.

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,345
And they, they realized that because in
fact,

45
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:40,130
Locked-in syndrome patients often are able
to do that.

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,290
So, what they, what occurred was, there
was a, a French alphabet.

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,820
In other words, the most common letters in
the

48
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,730
French language were listed from most
common to least common.

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,545
And when a person would point to each one
of

50
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:02,014
these letters or read them aloud and when
they got

51
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:07,355
to the correct letter Bauby would blink
his working eyelid

52
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:12,478
and he blinked out letter by letter this
entire story.

53
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:21,580
That's, that's just such an amazing
action, such an amazing accomplishment.

54
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,560
So with the one avenue that Bauby had to

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,420
express himself he did, and he did so
extremely eloquently.

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,750
I just reread this, I think I've read it
five

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,950
or six times, and it's just a really
interesting, moving book.

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,140
And what struck me when I read it this
time was, was the craving, the

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,580
craving for, for expression, for life, for
participation.

60
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,710
He unfortunately

61
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,640
he died just after this book was
published, it,

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,860
it's, it's a hard thing to live, with the

63
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,220
body not, being supported by, by the
central nervous system.

64
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,680
So the title, The Diving Bell and the

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,970
Butterfly, refers to his, his yin and
yang.

66
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,130
He's in a diving bell, in the sense that
his body is not under his control.

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,560
He cannot move.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,580
He is paralyzed.

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,770
At the same time, he has all sorts of
sensory abnormalities.

70
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,870
He's feeling, he feels pain, even though
he can't feel touch.

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,680
He can not feel actual stimuli, actual
things that are happening to his

72
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,450
body, but he feels these abnormal
sensations akin to amputation pain.

73
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,830
There's nothing there, but a person feels
pain.

74
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,860
Well, he feels that kind of sensation as
well.

75
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,240
So he's stuck in this diving bell.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,490
A diving bell is an iron globe that you
can, that people

77
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,920
used to use to, as submersibles to go down
into the ocean.

78
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,910
And he, that's all he can do is be in

79
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:16,240
this in this constrained existence where
he can't actually move himself.

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,710
But at the same time, he can, he can soar.

81
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,810
He can soar with his brain.

82
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,750
He can soar in his thoughts and his
emotions, his memories and his feelings.

83
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,760
And he does and he describes for instance
one, he

84
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,470
describes his feelings about Empress
Eugenie at the Naval Hospital.

85
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:45,760
And he describes this entire interaction
with at the hall in the Naval Hospital

86
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,320
with these various pieces of art, and he
describes it all in the present tense.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,020
It's as real as, as if it's happening.

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,191
It's happening in his brain and in fact,
that's our reality.

89
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,877
So, we're going to use The Diving Bell and

90
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:05,301
the Butterfly, and Bauby's experiences,
his, the things that

91
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,987
he lost, the things that he retained as a

92
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:12,087
framework within which we can explore the
nervous system.

93
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,926
Okay, we're going to get started now.

94
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:20,580
