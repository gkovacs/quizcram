2
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:14,000
So, in this unit,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,230
what we've seen is how one neuron can
formulate a message.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,689
Formulate a message in terms of action
potentials and send

5
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:30,544
that message on to another cell which can
receive the message.

6
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:35,830
And if, and that is a fascinating topic.

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:42,370
And yet, if we knew all the details,
everything that we ever could wish

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,958
to know about how, for instance,
neurotransmitter release occurs.

9
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:54,410
If we knew every single detail, it would
not tell us what

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,010
would happen if one of i, i, if the system
failed.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,440
Let's put it another way.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,010
Think about a demyelinating disease.

13
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,320
If we knew everything about how myelin
formed

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,140
and everything about how it, it fell
apart,

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,330
it wouldn't tell us what are going to be

16
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,780
the symptoms in a person with say,
multiple sclerosis.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,590
Because the symptoms depend not on the
particular

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,960
pathophysiology of how the myelin far,
falls apart.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,330
It depends on which neurons are affected.

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,760
And so, now we have to take our knowledge
about neuronal communication and

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,120
put it within the context of the
incredible complexity of neuroanatomy.

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,650
It depends on which neurons are affected.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,092
And so, we're going to look at
neuroanatomy.

24
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,060
We're going to look at what does the brain
do.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,210
What does the brain stem do?

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,450
What is the spinal cord?

27
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,818
How does the peripheral how does
information come in from

28
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:04,471
the periphery and go out, back out to the
muscles?

29
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,986
And that's what we'll do in the next unit.
