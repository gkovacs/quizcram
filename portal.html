<h1>Video Viewing Study Instructions</h1>

This is a study comparing two different video viewing tools in how effectively they help you learn. The scenario is, you are a student taking an introductory course on neuroscience, and you have a quiz coming up tomorrow. There are two sections that are being quizzed on, and you have allotted 40 minutes to studying each of them. You will be using a different video viewing tool to study each of the 2 sections.
<br><br>
This study is done entirely online, and will take about 2 hours total. The study is done over 2 days: on the first day, you view the videos and provide some feedback about the video viewing tools. On the second day (come back to this webpage 24 hours later), you take the quiz.
<br><br>

<h2>Second Day of Study</h2>

There will be some quizzes when you come visit this page tomorrow (24 hours after you started watching the videos). They should take about 30 minutes to complete. They are closed note, do not refer to any sources. Do not look at the videos from the first day either. If it has been 24 hours since you submitted the post-viewing survey and this page still looks the same <a href='mailto:geza@cs.stanford.edu'>email me</a>.
