<h1>Study Instructions</h1>

This is a study comparing two different video viewing tools in how effectively they help you learn. The scenario is, you are a student taking a course on neuroscience, and you have a quiz coming up tomorrow. There are two sections, and you have allotted 40 minutes to studying each of them. You will be using a different tool to watch each of the 2 sections.
