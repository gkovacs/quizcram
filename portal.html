<h1>Lecture-Video Viewing Tools Study</h1>

This is a study comparing two different video viewing tools in how effectively they help you learn from lecture videos. The scenario is, you are a student taking an introductory course on neuroscience, and you have a quiz coming up tomorrow. There are two sections that are being quizzed on, and you have allotted 40 minutes to studying each of them. You will be using a different video viewing tool to study each of the 2 sections.
<br><br>
This study is done entirely online, and will take about 2 hours total. The study is done over 2 days: on the first day, you view the videos and provide some feedback about the video viewing tools. On the second day (come back to this webpage 24 hours later), you take the quiz.

Please answer the following quizzes. Do them in the order they are listed in. Do not look at the videos, notes, or any external resources, just rely on what you remember from watching the videos 24 hours ago. Quiz 0 is fill-in-the-blank, the rest are shorter multiple-choice quizzes, there's no time limit but it will probably take less than 30 minutes to finish them all. Email me when done!
