<h1>Lecture-Video Viewing Study</h1>

This is a study comparing two different video viewing tools in how effectively they help you learn. The scenario is, you are a student taking an introductory course on neuroscience, and you have a quiz coming up tomorrow. There are two sections that are being quizzed on, and you have allotted 40 minutes to studying each of them. You will be using a different video viewing tool to study each of the 2 sections.
<br><br>
This study is done entirely online, and will take about 2 hours total. The study is done over 2 days: on the first day, you view the videos and provide some feedback about the video viewing tools. On the second day (come back to this webpage 24 hours later), you take the quiz.
<br><br>
