00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,447
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:11,487
Okay, so what we just talked about was
release and

3
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:16,887
that is release of neurotransmitter that
is packaged

4
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:22,370
into synaptic vesicles from the synaptic
terminal.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Well, the synaptic terminal is, the point
of that

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,820
is to get a message across to a second
cell.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,050
That's the post synaptic cell.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,310
This meeting is the synapse.

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,490
And these two neurons [COUGH] this, this
cell

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,260
with the synaptic terminal, which is the
pre-synaptic

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,050
cell and the post-synaptic cell, they are
separated

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,390
by a short distance called the synaptic
cleft.

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,660
And the molecules of neurotransmitter are
going to make their way

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,180
over to here where they are going to be
received.

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,110
That, we'll talk about that in the final
segment.

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,190
But the, but what we're going to talk
about

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,870
right now is the fact that as you send

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,280
this message out, as the synaptic terminal
sends this

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,870
message out, it has to have an end point.

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,480
A message that doesn't have an end point
is like

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,890
a lecture that never ends, that's
interminable, not so good.

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,360
So, in order to make a punchy point, we
have to have a beginning.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,320
We've got a great beginning, because we
know that release is triggered by

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,030
an action potential, by calcium, in,
influx and an, and an action potential.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,020
But now we need an end point, and we use

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,728
three different mechanisms to terminate
the message of a neurotransmitter.

27
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:51,970
One just happens naturally, which is
diffusion.

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,648
These molecules are going to diffuse out,
and this

29
00:01:56,648 --> 00:02:00,920
post-synaptic cell has ears, but those
ears are

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,790
only concentrated right here, so if the
molecule

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,370
is over here, the cell isn't hearing about
it.

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,980
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,640
So, diffusion is a very effective way to
terminate to

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,900
end, contribute to the termination of a,
of a message.

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,042
The second way is through something called
re-uptake.

36
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:31,060
And re-uptake [COUGH] are, is typically in
the pre-synaptic terminal.

37
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,940
There are channels or transporters.

38
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,080
They are actually not channels.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,430
They are called transporters and these
transporters take this neurotransmitter

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,730
back up and you'll be happy to know that
neurons totally believe in recycling.

41
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,440
They are not going to let that, that
neurotransmitter go to waste.

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,270
They'll repackage it.

43
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,600
They'll put it right back into a

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,380
new vesicle which is actually recycled as
well.

45
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,270
And so then, this, this cycles back.

46
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:14,750
So, the neurotransmitter, is taken up by
these re-uptake inhibitors.

47
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,162
I am sorry, these are re-uptake,
transporters.

48
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:23,890
So, re-uptake is a really, really
important way to terminate messages, and

49
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,870
this is really important for drugs like
serotonin and dopamine.

50
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,732
And there are drugs that act on the
serotonin

51
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:41,950
and dopamine re-uptake transporters that
can be used

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,930
both therapeutically, for instance, to
treat depression.

53
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,150
And also, that unfortunately engage,

54
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,840
circuits that lead to, abuse of drugs.

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,790
And so, for instance, cocaine, acts on a
dopamine, transporter.

56
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,090
The third way that we, terminate a message
is through degradation.

57
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,250
And, in the case of degradation, what we
have

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,010
is enzymes that sit out here in the
synaptic cleft.

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,245
That are just chewing up this, this
neurotransmitter.

60
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:27,564
[SOUND] It's like Pac-Man.

61
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:33,770
[SOUND] So, they're just going to eat up
this neurotransmitter, and, the,

62
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,310
the molecule, the neurotransmitter where
this

63
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,700
is really, really important is
acetylcholine.

64
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:50,528
So, in acetylcholine there is a enzyme
that sits in between the ne, the

65
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,720
pre-synaptic and post-synaptic cell that
eats up

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,030
that acetylcholine, and eats it up a lot.

67
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,160
So, very little of it actually makes its

68
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,634
way, acro, all the way across the synaptic
cleft.

69
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:05,880
If you block that enzyme.

70
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,917
And that enzyme is called

71
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:12,800
acetylcholinesterase, which is abbreviated
like that.

72
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,960
If you block that, you'll have a lot of
acetylcholine.

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,640
Remember that acetylcholine is the
neurotransmitter

74
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,740
that is used by motor neurons.

75
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,380
And so, in fact, this, blocking the
acetylcholinesterase

76
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,480
can be used for therapeutics in the case
of people that are not releasing

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,300
enough acetylcholine, or don't have

78
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,790
enough, receptors for the acetylcholine,
we

79
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,350
can boost the amount of acetylcholine

80
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,410
in the cleft by inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase.

81
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,180
And that's useful for people with things
like diseases such as myasthenia gravis.

82
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,600
We can also use, or people

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,130
also use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
for nefarious purposes.

84
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,350
And a lot of pesticides drugs such as
Serin are

85
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,479
based on blocking this and the effect of
that is that the

86
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,435
acetylcholine, there is so much

87
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,100
acetylcholine that floods this
post-synaptic cell

88
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,450
which, in the case of a motor neuron, is a
muscle.

89
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,310
So the motor neuron is talking to a
muscle.

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,790
And now the motor neuron is not ever
shutting up.

91
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,610
That means that the muscle is contracted
and it stays contracted.

92
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,720
Well, it's okay to contract but it's not
okay to stay contracted.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,230
So, imagine if your diaphragm stayed
contracted?

94
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,710
No more breathing.

95
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,575
And so, that, that's the problem with
these acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

96
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,190
Okay.

97
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,270
And then the final segment we're going to
look at receptors.

98
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,750
How do we hear the message?

99
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,960
How does the post-synaptic cell hear the

100
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,990
message?

101
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,020
