2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:15,730
Okay, so we're going to talk about myelin
now.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,180
Myelin is a, is a fatty wrap that goes
around some axons.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,480
Now, what's the difference between a
myelinated axon and a naked axon?

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,170
A naked axon is one that doesn't have
mylelin, so it's unmylinated.

6
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:42,380
so, an unmylinated, or naked axon, can
only, transfer information at a slow rate.

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:49,100
So the rate that it's transfers
information is 0.2 to 1 meters per second.

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,340
That means to go 1 and a half

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,533
meters, which is roughly the distance
between [COUGH]

10
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,510
my toe, and right here.

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,080
To go that distance would take me seconds.

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,890
At least, a second and a half.

13
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,930
And probably more like 5 seconds.

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,430
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,500
Now, once we put on myelin, information
transfers much much faster.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,820
It can go between 2 and 120 meters per
second.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,400
If it goes at 120 meters per second, the
whole game is over.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,478
Information is gone from here to here in
12 milliseconds.

19
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,239
.012 seconds.

20
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,940
So very short time, in perceptible to us.

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,010
And that is a, obviously a very useful
thing, so

22
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,160
that we can get information in time to
actually use it.

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,930
So, the information that we need the,

24
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,410
the fastest is information about keeping
our balance.

25
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,140
And so, as we walk along, if we bump

26
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,670
into something and we stumble, we need
that information fast.

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,540
If we had to wait for a second or two,
we'd be on the ground.

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,180
All the neurons that support our posture

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,680
against gravity, those neurons transfer
information really fast.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,210
Alright, so let's talk a little bit

31
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,576
more about the information that gets
transferred.

32
00:02:15,576 --> 00:02:20,457
That information occurs in, it's a 0 or a
1.

33
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,899
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:26,960
There's either an a point of information
or not.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,540
And so it's very much like a computer

36
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,560
code, where what we're seeing is a series
of

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,690
of 0s or 1s and what's important,

38
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,288
the 0s are less important but the temporal
pattern of these ones is very important.

39
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:52,716
So, we want to know, at every millisecond,
is there a 1 or is there a 0?

40
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:56,960
If there's a 1 we want to know the
temporal pattern of those ones.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,500
That's the neural code.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,280
And these ones are actually, I, I'm
going to give you the name for that.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,765
That's an action potential,

44
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:08,780
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,730
also called a spike.

46
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,890
And we talk about firing spikes, neurons
fire spikes.

47
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,149
So, the timing of these spikes is what
carries information.

48
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,520
The spikes are going to travel down this
axon, so lets now imagine

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,310
in this situation that blue here is
supposed to be the miling.

50
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,230
These are wraps and their wraps that go
around the axon.

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,970
I, I've, I've drawn it as a cut away, but
the wrap will go all the way around here.

52
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,130
And the information, the spikes actually
jump.

53
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,790
That's what makes it so fast.

54
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,740
They don't have to they don't have to,
actually be

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,460
carried through the places with the
Myelin, they can actually jump.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,870
And so things, anthra, the spike
information

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,590
is transferred very quickly, down this
axon.

58
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,970
Now, if we lose this myelin, if we lose
this myelin, just

59
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,230
a little bit of myelin here, now, this is
going to creep along.

60
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,000
And it actually, it's either going to be
really slowed or it may fail altogether.

61
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,834
So, this if our original message is this.

62
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:24,334
[SOUND].

63
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,190
And now, we have a demyelinating disease,
what

64
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,730
we're going to end up with is something
that's

65
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,140
spread out, because it's slower.

66
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,640
And every once in a while, it's going to
miss bits.

67
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:49,770
And now, the neuron that we're talking to
is getting a very incoherent message.

68
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,707
This is very different from this and that
is the problem with demyelination.

69
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:57,832
By, because an [UNKNOWN] because axons are

70
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,920
demyelinated, the information transfer is
very degraded.

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,290
It's a garbled message and that's a
problem.

72
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:11,020
And so in the next segment what we're
going to look at is the two different

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,223
major types of demyelinating diseases.
