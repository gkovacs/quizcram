2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,200
Okay, so let's talk about botox.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,480
Botox is one of the, one of

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,270
several clostridial toxins, made by
clostridial bacteria.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,595
And the full name of Botox is actually
botulinum toxin.

6
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:33,850
And to understand what botulinum toxin
does, we need to know one more thing.

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,940
We, what I told you is that the vesicles

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,670
are, are held very close to the cell
membrane.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,300
What holds them?

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,870
A group of three proteins.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,630
Two of them anchored in the cell membrane,
one of them

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,090
anchored in the vesicle membrane the
details don't matter as much.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,200
But this complex is called the Snare
Complex.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,200
And what happens is that when calcium
comes in.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,090
It changes its shape.

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,469
It changes its conformation.

17
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:17,420
And it goes from, doing like that to being
in a straight line.

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,150
So that pushes the vesicle into the plasma
membrane and fusion is inevitable.

19
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,040
Resistance is futile.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,240
So you have to, at that point, when
they're that close, they have to fuse.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,200
It takes a lot of energy for them not to

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,336
fuse, and when they're that close,
there's, it, it, it's inevitable.

23
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:46,440
Okay, so, it's this snare pin, and it's
the

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,840
snare pin's sensitivity to calcium that is
the final event that

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,485
allows the vesicle to fuse with the cell
membrane.

26
00:01:56,485 --> 00:02:01,669
Botox comes in and cuts any one of these

27
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:07,395
well, Botox cuts a particular one.

28
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:12,409
But the clostridial toxins cut a variety
of places

29
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:17,890
in these three proteins that make up the
snare pin.

30
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,890
If the snare pin is broken, for whatever

31
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,170
reason, if that is cut then release
doesn't happen.

32
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,630
And it's as simple as that.

33
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:36,520
So, what, what the clostridial toxins are
doing is blocking release.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,130
Now, if you block release, if somebody is
administered

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,460
a sufficient dose of botulinum toxin, the
release

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,890
that we have to care about is the release
from a motor neuron to the diaphragm.

37
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,430
The diaphragm is the thing that allows us
to breathe.

38
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,870
Diaphragm is a muscle right here, right in
there.

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,610
And we need our diaphragm to contract and
without the diaphragm, we don't breathe.

40
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,556
Without breathing, we don't get oxygen to
our brain.

41
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:11,490
And without oxygen in the brain, we're
going to die.

42
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,030
So, so, it's a deadly weapon.

43
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,480
And when I first started teaching, in, in,
1992 or in the 90s

44
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,930
we used to talk about the fact that the
clostridial toxins were potential

45
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,878
weapons of, of, of mass destruction, so to
speak.

46
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:39,960
So, [COUGH]
mass death, anyway.

47
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,057
So now we use them all the time.

48
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:50,598
And we use them for very serious problems
things like focal dystonia.

49
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:56,502
Where there is a a, a, a in, inappropriate

50
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:02,010
continual contraction of a muscle.

51
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,870
And that, it's a basal ganglia disorder.

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,820
There are a lot of famous people that have
had, have focal dystonia.

53
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,590
Leon Fleisher is a piano player who has
it, in, in his right hand.

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,408
So these two fingers are, are always
contracted.

55
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:25,880
And Diane Rehm has it in her larynx.

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,460
So she has laryngeal focal dystonia.

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,209
And these people are treated with Botox.

58
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:41,890
So the Botox is injected at a very low
dose at a very local, very locally.

59
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,650
So, it's blocking the contraction of these
two fingers in the Leon Fleishers example.

60
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,435
And in the larynx, it's blocking the

61
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:56,190
cont, spasmodic contraction of the
laryngeal muscles.

62
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:04,110
So, and it's used for a large variety of
of, of treatments, of various disorders.

63
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,800
It's also used cosmetically.

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,132
And the interesting thing about its use in
cosmetics is that I don't think

65
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:17,184
that we fully understood, before the
widespread use of Botox.

66
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:22,156
That, we make our own, we make our own
wrinkles.

67
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:25,632
And there's a lovely quote about how smile
lines are

68
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:30,440
really great, because they show us how
much we've been smiling.

69
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,418
In fact, we are making our wrinkles, and
what Botox is doing

70
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,758
is preventing the motor neuron from

71
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:40,174
releasing the neurotransmitter onto the
muscle.

72
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,470
And thereby preventing us from actively
making our own wrinkles.

73
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,800
okay.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,570
So we've gotten our transmitter release.

75
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,633
And now what we're going to talk about is,
is how, we, we've started our

76
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:59,090
expression, we've started our sends, and
now we have to stop our sends.

77
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,896
So we're going to talk about termination
of the signal

78
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,398
that comes out of the neuron in the next
segment.
