2
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,905
So, we're going to talk now about the
difference between

3
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:18,779
the Central Nervous System and the
Peripheral Nervous System.

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,940
There's a barrier,there's a fence, and
that

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,510
fence is the demarcation between central
and peripheral.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,740
And that fence is made up of three

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,230
membranes, and those three membranes are
the meninges.

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,280
There are three meningeal layers, and the
three layers

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,400
go from very weak, very tender, the pia,
to very

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,610
tough, the dura and, in between, there's a
spidery

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,619
thing called the arachnoid, a spidery
layer called the arachnoid.

12
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,990
So, let's just look at what that looks
like.

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,260
We're only going to see the arachnoid in,
in this next picture.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,660
So here, this is the brain, and what's
covering the brain here, up here

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,606
is pia and you can't see it, it's so thin,
and so tender that we don't see it.

16
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:19,550
But in this view, the dura has been
removed and now we're looking down on this

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,280
film, it's a, it's an actual membrane, and
that membrane is the arachnoid.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,284
So, the different meningeal layers have
different purposes, different functions.

19
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:37,320
The dura is the, is a tough sack, and that
is

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,501
what's going to keep us from having
concussions all the time.

21
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:46,080
All right, so it's going to float our
brain in in fluid

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,510
and prevent it from banging about, and,
and actually getting bruised.

23
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,610
It takes a hard hit to actually injure the
brain,

24
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,170
and hopefully we, we don't have, we don't
incur that.

25
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,750
Okay, so the meninges go from, pia is
closest to the central nervous

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,240
system, is closest to the brain and spinal
cord, and then dura is farthest away.

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,080
And their, all the neurons, almost all of
the neurons in the central nervous

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,885
system, 200 billion minus something less
than

29
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:24,990
100,000 are contained completely within
the central neurons.

30
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,720
The only neurons that leave the central
nervous system,

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,260
are these neurons that, that serve a motor
function.

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,898
They actually go out the meninges and they
go into the periphery.

33
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:41,654
In the periphery, there's the peripheral
nervous system,

34
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,789
and there's also every, the rest of the
body.

35
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,767
So there are motor neurons, they go to
skeletal muscle, the

36
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,390
voluntary muscle, so that we can move our
arms and our legs.

37
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,240
And these are motor neurons.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,450
And then there are Motor neurons that go
to Autonomic Neurons that control our

39
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,509
glands, that controls the cardiac muscle,
they control our gut, smooth muscle.

40
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,705
So for instance, these are going to be,
these neurons are what is

41
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:16,210
going to be active when you see food and
you start to salivate.

42
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,660
Well, somebody's got to tell that gland to
start salivating and

43
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,274
it's the brain and it does it through this
two neuron chain.

44
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:26,690
So, those are Autonomic Neurons.

45
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,280
In addition to the motor neurons that
carry information from the

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,490
central nervous system to the peripheral
nervous system, there are sensory neurons.

47
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,470
And these sensory neurons are peripheral.

48
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,310
They are located peripherally, and they

49
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,220
carry information into the central nervous
system.

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,296
What you'll note is we call a neuron
either

51
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,870
or sensorial or peripheral based on where
the cell body

52
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,170
is not based on where its axon is or

53
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,620
its dendrites, but based on where the cell
body is.

54
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,460
So these Peripheral Neurons include
Sensory Neurons and

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,780
Autonomic Neurons, these are in the
autonomic ganglia.

56
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,331
The consequence of that is that these
neurons share vulnerabilities.

57
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:14,009
The, the, they share with each other but
not with the central neurons.

58
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:20,560
So, for example, there's a disease called
Congenital insensitivity to pain.

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,420
People with this disease suffered a
mutation in

60
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,800
one of a number of developmental,
developmentally important genes.

61
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,078
And what it did was it, it, prevented a
group of sensory neurons

62
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:41,222
from developing, those sensory neurons
that respond to injury.

63
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:44,342
So, these people are insensitive, they
never

64
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:47,696
feel pain, because they can't, they don't
have

65
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:50,894
the sensory neurons that will respond to
noxious

66
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:54,325
stimulation which is what usually brings
us pain.

67
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,867
But in addition, there's a group of

68
00:04:56,867 --> 00:05:00,557
the Autonomic Neurons that also
developmentally got

69
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:05,629
knocked out, and these are the neurons
that lead you to be able to sweat.

70
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,565
And so, people with Congenital
insensitivity to pa, to

71
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:14,570
pain often have what's called anhydrous,
meaning they can't sweat.

72
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,660
Those seem like two completely weird
symptoms to put

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,910
together, but they're not weird because
they make complete sense.

74
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,390
Both of them are due to a

75
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,140
developmental abnormality in the
peripheral nervous system.

76
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,640
So, in the next segment what we're
going to do is, is look again, look a

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,735
little bit more closely at other diseases
that preferentially affect either the

78
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:47,920
periphery or the central nervous system.

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,970
