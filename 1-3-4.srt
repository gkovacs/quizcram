2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,441
So just like any stars, neurons need a lot
of support.

3
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:23,661
And in fact, the support cells of the, of
the nervous

4
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:29,461
system are called glial cells, and they
outnumber the

5
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:35,049
the neurons in number by ten to one, at
least ten to one.

6
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:38,415
So, there are ten times more glial cells

7
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:43,800
supporting the stars then there are stars
themselves.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,050
So, the neurons, are a minority of what's
in the nervous system.

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,100
And so, let's, let's think about what do
the glial cells do.

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,190
Well, the glial cells clean up after the
neurons.

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:03,780
They take all the stuff that the neurons
dump into the extra cellular space,

12
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,800
and they take it up, and they recycle it,
and they prepare it for re-use.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:18,010
They form the scaffolding that allows
these synpases to form.

14
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,720
They, they maintain these synapses by, by
making

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,940
sure that the two, that the synaptic
terminal and the neuron

16
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,330
that it's talking to are held tightly
together.

17
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,060
They can't talk across very long distances
and so these, this synapse

18
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,500
is a very delicate structure and it has to
be just so.

19
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,390
And who does that?

20
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,780
Not the neurons.

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,400
It's the glial cells that, that do that.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,490
The, the glial cells are also critical to
the development of the nervous system.

23
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,850
Neurons don't get born and move to where
they need to go to without glial cells.

24
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,060
So, glial cells are absolutely, the brain
is, is not going to work without the glial

25
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,300
cells anymore than a city is going to work
without sanitation workers and

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,360
all sorts of city support staff.

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,890
Okay?

28
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,970
So, the neurons need the glial cells.

29
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,920
There are different types of glial cells,
and we're not going to go

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,090
through all of them but we're going to
mention just a few of them.

31
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,780
Astrocytes are the ones that, these are
the most numerous type of glial cells.

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,690
And these are cell, glial cells in the
central

33
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,610
nervous system, that are doing all this
cleaning up.

34
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,660
They're doing the cleaning up.

35
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,530
They're doing the scaffolding.

36
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,900
They are the work horses of the central
nervous system.

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,110
Then there are two different glial cells
who's job it is

38
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,890
to make myelin and we're going to spend
some time on myelin.

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,370
Myelin is an insulating wrap for axons.

40
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,870
And there are two different types of glial
cells that make myelin because one of

41
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,500
them makes it for central neurons, and one
of them makes it for peripheral neurons.

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,470
So oligodendrocytes make myelin for
central neurons,

43
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,920
and Schwann cells make myelin for
peripheral neurons.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,170
And we'll come back to that.

45
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,950
So myelin is a, it's a fatty substance
that surrounds the axons.

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,210
And what we're going to talk about in the
next segment is what does myelin do that's

47
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,770
so important and why is it a problem, a
big problem, in fact, if we lose myelin?

48
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,330
And, and losing myelin is the

49
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,020
basis for demyelining diseases such
multiple sclerosis.

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,026
Okay.

51
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,717
So in the next segment, we'll talk about
myelin.
