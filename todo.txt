move the intro video [1-1-1] so that it is a preview, watched before the others. remove associated supplementary quiz question (please watch the introductory video first, you will not be tested on it but it will help you understand the other lectures)

remove video 1-3-3 neuronal uniqueness and associated question

half 1: 1-2-1 [four functions] -> 1-3-4 [glial cells]
half 2: 1-3-5 [myelin] -> 1-4-3 [brain tumors]

question "A mutation that led to the degeneration of glial cells could result in which of the following?" is probably half 1, but could technically also be half 2

write some supplementary questions for the brain tumors section

more quizzes for the myelin part?

ensure that the supplementary video questions are of equal density in both parts

current in-video quizzes have an implicit implication that the answer is to be found between the end of the previous in-video quiz (or the start of the video, if there was no previous in-video quiz), or . Although this is conceptually simple - each video segment is tested by only up to one quiz - it reduces the flexibility in writing questions, particularly those that cover multiple portions of the video.

To give a concrete example, in the neurobiology course, there was a lecture on brain anatomy where . We wished to add an additional question about the forebrain, but .

 we had a video about a general topic (brain anatomy), which covers the forebrain at the time interval 0:00 to 1:00, then the brainstem at the time interval 1:00 to 2:00. Suppose we have 2 questions we want to have students answer while watching the video: the first covers the forebrain (so it requires the student to have watched 0:00 to 1:00), then the second compares the forebrain and the brainstem (so it requires the student to have watched 0:00 to 2:00).

Thus, the current in-video quiz model limits the flexibility in writing questions that cover overlapping content.
