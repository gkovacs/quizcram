2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,345
So the approach that we're

3
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:18,480
going to use in this course is to use
Bobby's story, to

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,340
organize our consideration of
neurobiology.

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,200
So, we're going to look at perception, and

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,290
then we're going to look at motor
function, and

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,260
then we're going to look at homeostasis,
and

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,390
then we're going to look at higher
abstract functions.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,990
Before we get to that, we're going to
spend the

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,020
first, the, the next three weeks, getting
some vocabulary.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,820
So, making sure that we can use the same
words and we can understand each other.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,200
So we're going to go through how do
neurons

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
talk to each other, we're going to
understand about neuroanatomy.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,870
We're going to understand the basics, how
the brain and spinal cord develop.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,350
And then, how they actually are organized
in the adult.

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,410
And then, we're going to look at what goes
wrong in

17
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,710
the central nervous system, and we're
going to focus on strokes.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,840
After we have that vocabulary, and our
basic understanding of how the

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,910
brain is structured both physiologically
and anatomically, we are going to go into

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,240
topics, and the first topic is we're
going to look at perception and

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,720
we are going to use two pers, perceptual
modalities to look at this.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,310
We are going to look at vision, and we are
going to look at hearing.

23
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,080
There are other perceptions that we have,
obviously, touch and the stimuli

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,080
sense, taste and smell and we are not
going to talk about those.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,720
We have to pick and choose here.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,750
So we are going to look at vision and
hearing,

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,900
pro, arguably the two most important
senses for humans.

28
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,950
Then we are going to talk about how we
control voluntary movement.

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,030
And we're going to divide this into two
different units, one where we're going to

30
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:09,020
talk about the hierarchy that gets us from
essentially from polio to a stroke.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,080
So, how do you move a muscle?

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,710
How do you actually make an intentional
movement

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,329
such as, raising your hand or moving your
hand?

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:24,620
And then we're going to go into the, the
modulatory part of, of movement.

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,900
How do we organize?

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,520
How do we coordinate movement?

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,870
How do we make movements go faster?

38
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,280
How do we make them habitual movements?

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,210
So then we'll spend a unit on that, as
well.

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,690
Then we'll move on to homeostatis, we're
going to

41
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,940
look at how mothers become bonded to their
children.

42
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,210
How that works when they give birth, and
when they're nursing, we'll look at

43
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,610
thermal regulation and breathing, voiding
urine and

44
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,840
we will look at the sleep wake cycle.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,760
So these are all things that we have to
do, to stay alive, we have to do

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,850
and they are supported by both automatic
and intentional movements.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,640
And finally, we'll end up with executive
function, or

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,520
higher abstract function, and here we'll
focus on emotions.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,020
We'll focus mostly on emotions and memory,
and

50
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,420
we'll end up talking about how we can play

51
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,520
well with others, and the challenges that
are

52
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,160
that playing well with others presents to
the brain.

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,618
Okay, so I hope to see you next week.

54
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,080
